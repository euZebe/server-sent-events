# server-sent events

## HOWTO

- `yarn server` to start the server
- `yarn start` to start the client

## What

The client subscribes to a stream of events sent by the server (Oh, wait ! We could call that "server-sent events" ! ğŸ˜ƒ).

Once a subscriber is registered, the server sends random strings during 10 seconds, which are displayed by the UI.
